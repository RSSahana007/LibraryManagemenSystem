# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

##### A Database Management System Course Project containing all the features, SQL scripts, and options to serve as a DBMS for State Town Library ðŸš€


### Introduction:
This project is a Library Management System designed to handle all activities related to the books in a library. The system keeps track of the available books, their lending details, and the records managed by the library staff. In addition to managing day-to-day operations, it also maintains information about the status of issued books as well as their respective publishers.

### Mission Objective:
The main goal of this project is to improve convenience and efficiency for both staff and customers. To meet this goal, a system was developed where customers must register at a specific branch before borrowing books, allowing tracking of both customer activity and branch-specific data. Once a book is issued, the customer can view the issuance status to monitor their borrowings. At the same time, staff members can manage and update the availability and condition of all books in the library.
